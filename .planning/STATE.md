### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 5 phases derived from 87 v1 requirements across 15 categories

- 01-01: Used global viper singleton for Phase 1 (standard Cobra pattern)
- 01-01: Root command RunE shows help when invoked without subcommands
- 01-01: HumanRenderer uses text prefixes when color disabled for accessibility
- 01-02: ClientFactory uses RWMutex double-check locking for thread-safe per-tenant credential caching
- 01-02: Auth providers are separate types implementing AuthProvider interface (not a single switch-case function)
- 01-02: Mock provider used in factory tests instead of real azidentity calls to avoid Azure dependency in CI
